Iran is feeling the pinch. The re-introduction
of U-S sanctions has had a crippling effect

2
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.550
on the economy.
The value of the Rial has plummeted - pushing

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.250
inflation to over 30 percent. And US President
Donald Trump's attempt to destroy the country's

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.080
oil industry is having an effect too.
The influential middle-classes are among those

5
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.350
being hit hard.
The economic war is a reality and people are

6
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.320
under extreme pressure. They keep telling
us to be strong, but we can already hear the

7
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.370
sound of our bones breaking under this pressure.
Some are being pushed below the poverty line.

8
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.660
As far as I can see, people's purchasing power
has been more than halved. Anyone earning

9
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.289
between one point five million rials to two
million rials a month, between 35 and 47 US

10
00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.650
dollars, who also needs to pay rent, won't
be able to even afford to buy bread and potatoes.

11
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:06.430
It is unimaginable."
The lifting of sanctions in 2016 spurred rapid

12
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.899
growth of more than 12 percent. But their
reimposition last year dealt a massive blow.

13
00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.149
The International Monetary Fund is forecasting
the Iranian economy to SHRINK by SIX percent

14
00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.259
this year.
The withdrawal of foreign companies has also

15
00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.100
driven up unemployment. European firms that
have left include carmakers Mercedes and Peugeot.

16
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.479
But smaller firms are also becoming increasingly
wary of doing business in Iran.

17
00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.410
Should Iran follow through on its threat to
enrich uranium beyond permitted levels, the

18
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:57.229
nuclear deal could collapse entirely.
In

19
00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:46.299
that case, UN sanctions would also be

20
00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:46.409
re-imposed.
